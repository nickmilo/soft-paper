# Soft Paper
A custom Obsidian theme to feel more reflective. 

I went ahead and forked this from the AnuPpuccin theme. Thanks to the creator of that theme. But with multiple bases open, it slowed down more than other themes. That slowdown is no good, and more importantly, I made that theme the standard for Ideaverse Pro, so it has gotten in the way of a fast experience for some people. 

So I was determined to keep the same Soft Papery goodness, but to make things noticeably faster. 

This theme reduces the code by 86% and is much, much faster. For example, the CPU-expensive tab switching animation is gone. (This alone makes a big difference when you have multiple bases open.) All the old options are stripped. 

This is solely for Soft Paper lovers.

## Style Settings
If you install the 3rd-party plugin "Style Settings," I have a few style settings for you to toggle. These are settings I toggle, so I thought you might like them too.

- **Hide scrollbars**
- M**ake bases compact**
  - Tighter vertical spacing in Bases plugin tables
- **Make file explorer compact**
  - Tighter vertical spacing in the file explorer
- **Hide "Add property" button**
  - Remove the "Add property" button below properties
- **Make status bar blue**
  - Toggle the lower-right file details bar between blue and beige
- **Make settings see-through**
  - Settings window at 90% opacity so you can see changes live

I especially like toggling the options to make the bases and file explorer compact. Look at the before and after below.
