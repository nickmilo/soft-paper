# soft-paper
A custom Obsidian theme to feel more reflective.

Forked from the AnuPpuccin theme. Thanks to the creator of that theme. 

This theme reduces the code by 86% and is much, much faster. For example, the CPU-expensive tab switching animation is gone. (This alone makes a big difference when you have multiple bases open.) All the old options are stripped.
